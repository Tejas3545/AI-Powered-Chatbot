## 📌 Overview

This project is an **AI-Powered Chatbot** that allows users to interact with a conversational assistant in real-time.  
It is built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend, integrates a lightweight database (`SQLite`), and serves a **responsive web-based frontend** with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and AI-driven logic in building interactive systems.
